                        <p>  In this ever-changing technological landscape, the positive impacts of  technology on society cannot be ignored.We are living in an age where  advancements in technology have made life more convenient and  efficient than ever before.By utilizing cutting-edge tools and  techniques, humanity has been able to break down many barriers that  previously kept us from achieving our goals.From providing improved  healthcare services to increasing access to education, there is no  denying the fact that technology has had a profoundly salutary effect  on our lives.With the advent of new technologies such as artificial  intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR) and machine learning algorithms,  we now have unprecedented capabilities which allow us to solve  complex problems with ease and precision. Human societies and technology have grown inextricably linked since  technical systems like mobile phones, computers, TV, etc. are produced  by humans and reflect the very basis of a populationâ€™s needs and  lifestyle. Although technology improves the lifestyle of human beings, it  is also a major concern for future generations. Nowadays, people are  excessively using technology which reduces their physical activities and  directly affects their health. Technology has a more positive impact on  humans or society as compared to negative. It makes our life easier and  reward us by providing resources or tool that make our life much  easier.</p>
